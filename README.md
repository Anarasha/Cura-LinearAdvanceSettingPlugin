# LinearAdvanceSettingPlugin

This plugin adds a setting named "Linear Advance Factor", and a number of feature-specific subsettings to the Material category in the Custom print setup of Cura. The plugin inserts M900 commands in the gcode to set the Linear Advance Factor for Marlin-based printers that have the LIN_ADVANCE feature enabled.
